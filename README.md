# Banking Customer Churn Prediction

This is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) project focused on predicting banking customer churn. The objective is to identify which customers are most likely to leave the bank based on various historical characteristics and behaviors. To achieve this, we implemented and compared several machine learning models to determine which one offers the best predictive performance.

## Implemented Models

We implemented a variety of models to evaluate which one has the best prediction score, including:
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Neural Networks

## Group

This project was developed by group *A2_7*, consisting of:
